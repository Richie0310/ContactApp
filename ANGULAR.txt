ANGULAR - front end development framework

basic commands
1. Create project - ng new projectname
2. Run project - ng serve -o
3. Generating Components: ng g c componentname
4.Angular services - ng g s service-folder/service-name
5. Angular pipe - ng g p pipe-folder/pipe-name


basic building blocks

1. Module - Used to import 3rd parties libraries
2. Components - To create HTML page (html,css,ts)
3. Selector - It will replace the html page for that component
4. Angular services - Reusable code that can share between components
5. Asynchronous functuin - RxJs
6. Observable - 
   subscribe(call back)
   7. to get http methods
   8. dependency injection - perform inside constructor
      syntax: access specifier variable-name:class-name
   9. Data Binding - Data sharing inside a component
      - One way Binding 
        - Components (ts) to view (html)
           String Interpolation - {{class variable name}}
           property Binding - [attribute]="property-name"
        - view(html) to component (ts)
          event binding - (event-name)="function-name()"
          event binding using $event argument - (event-name)="function-name($event)"
      - Two way binding
        - using ngModel:
          -Import FormsModule in appModule
          - [(ngModel)]="property-name"


   10. Directives - DOM Manipulation
      - Component Directives
      - Structural Directives - to add or remove html elements based on a condition or length of an array.
         *ngIf ="condition"
         *ngFor="let variable-name of array-name"   

         11. Pipe -  transform user input to another format
